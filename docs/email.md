Subject: Update on Your Support Request – API Service Improvements

Dear Client,

We hope this message finds you well. We are writing to update you regarding the recent issues you reported with our API services. Our team has completed a thorough review and implemented important improvements to ensure a smoother and more secure experience for you and your users.

**What was happening?**
- Some users were unable to access the API after reaching their daily usage limit, even after waiting for a new day to begin. This caused repeated error messages and interruptions in service.
- Additionally, our audit logs were showing full API keys, which could potentially expose sensitive information.

**What have we done to fix it?**
- We have updated our system so that usage limits are now automatically reset every 24 hours. This means that if you reach your daily limit, you will be able to use the API again the next day without any extra steps.
- We have also improved the way we display information in our audit logs. Now, your API keys are masked, showing only the first few characters, so your sensitive data remains private and protected.

**How can you verify the changes?**
- Try making several API requests until you reach your daily limit. After 24 hours, you should be able to use the API again as expected.
- If you access the audit logs, you will notice that your API keys are now partially hidden for your security.

**What’s next?**
- These changes are already live, and you do not need to take any action. If you have any questions or notice anything unusual, please let us know right away. We are here to help!

Thank you for your patience and for bringing these matters to our attention. Your feedback helps us make our services better for everyone.

Best regards,

The Support Team
